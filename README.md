Prototype Augmented Reality App for viewing geographic data

## Status

This is a rough prototype project that is used to explore a few concepts of Augmented Reality for civic engagement. 

It is not yet meant to be a good example or re-usable libraries. That might happen in the future. 

There are two primary scenes

- Community Designer
  - This Scene uses physical cards to display pop-up models for tabletop design of a park
- World Lens
  - Loads geographic data such as trees, building permits, road crashes, and overlays on physical world through the camera
